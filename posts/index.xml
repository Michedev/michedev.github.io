In this way a neural network can learn how to reverse the process but in this post we&amp;rsquo;ll focus onto the math behind the noising step. To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s define the single noising step of the diffusion process as follows:
$$X_t \sim N( \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} X_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I}) $$</description></item><item><title>The stranger of Albert Camus</title><link>https://michedev.github.io/posts/the_stranger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michedev.github.io/posts/the_stranger/</guid><description>Introduction Two weeks ago I decided to read the book &amp;ldquo;The stranger&amp;rdquo; by Albert Camus.
