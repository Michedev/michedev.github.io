            In this website and in recent versions of CV i didn't mentioned my university results because IMHO they are indicative about achieving a knowledge,
            a competence but with large variance of effectively knowledge acquired, speaking in statistically terms.
            In simpler words there are many ways to pass an exam, either by learning the concept given by the exam or not (e.g. memorize information and after some days forget anything)
            With this example in mind, the learning process that an exam should give is avoided but i don't say that everyone do exams in this ways, but that there are some learn rightly and some not.
            With this point of view i say that exams results and certifications are indicative about person competence but not too much and IMO the only way
            to verify is talk with him/her.
