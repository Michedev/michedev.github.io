                <li>Math</li>
                <li>Statistic</li>

                <li>Machine learning</li>
            </ul>
            Outside university arguments, i can teach
            <ul>
                <li>Programming - learn from basis to write good code and most common programmer tools/libraries</li>
                <li>Machine learning - how to do in practice and how to do a Data Analysis process</li>
            </ul>
            The price for repetition is 20 eur/hour, we can talk about it if you need a long period of lessons

        <h5 class="card-title">My thoughts about university exams</h5>
        <div class="text-card-description">
            In this website and in recent versions of CV i didn't mentioned my university results because IMHO they are
            indicative about achieving a knowledge,
            a competence but with large variance of effective knowledge acquired, speaking in statistical terms.
            In other words there are many ways to pass an exam, either by learning the concept given by the exam or not
            (e.g. memorize information and after some days forget anything)
            With this example in mind, the learning process that an exam should give is avoided but i don't say that
            everyone do exams in this ways, but that there are some learn rightly and some not.
            With this point of view i say that exams results are indicative about person competence but not too much
            and IMO the only way
            to verify is talk with him/her.
